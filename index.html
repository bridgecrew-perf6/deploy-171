      Developed by <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Game Freak</a> and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series
      began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called
      "Pokémon" that players, called <a href="https://google.com">"trainers", are encouraged to capture,
      train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the
      game's world.[5] Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs
      conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko
      Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design,

      6][7] which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori.[8][9] According to
      series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of
      two Japanese onomatopoeia: ピカピカ (pikapika), a sparkling sound, and
      チュウチュウ (chūchū), a sound a mouse makes.[10] Despite its name's
      origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's original design, especially its
      cheeks, on squirrels.[11] Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as
      one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing
      to both Japanese and American audiences
