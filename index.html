      Developed by <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Game Freak</a> and
      published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and
      features several species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players,
      called <a href="https://google.com">"trainers"</a>, are encouraged to
      capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with
      the game's world.[5] <a href="https://www.napkins.com">Pikachu</a> was one
      of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character
      development team. <em>Artist Atsuko Nishida</em> is credited as the main
      person behind Pikachu's design,

        6][7] which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori.[8][9] According
        to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a
        combination of two Japanese <strong>onomatopoeia</strong>: ピカピカ
        (pikapika), a sparkling sound, and チュウチュウ (chūchū), a sound a
        mouse makes.[10] Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based
        Pikachu's original design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.[11]
        Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most
        difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both
        Japanese and American audiences
